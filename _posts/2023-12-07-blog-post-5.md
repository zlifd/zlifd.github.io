Blog Post #5
======
Reconstruction a 3D point cloud and camera pose of a given image set. 

In this project, we are going to implement the full pipeline of Structure from Motion, including two-view reconstruction, triangulation, PnP, and bundle adjustment.Assume the intrinsic matrix K of camera is known.

1.1: Introduction 
======
<br>
Structure from Motion (SFM) helps to estimate the 3-D structure of a scene from a set of 2-D images. It is a process to reconstruct a 3D scene and simultaneously obtain the camera poses of a monocular camera w.r.t. the given scene. The main pipeline of this project includes the following:
<br>
<br>

Initialization:
<br>
1.  Feature points detection and find matching between the first 2 images, SIFT detector is used in this project.
<br>
2.  Finding Essential Matrix E, where (y')^T*E*y = 0
<br>
3.  Recovering Camera Pose From E to obtain the rotation R & Translation T, 
<br>
4.  Obtaining the 3D points by Triangulation
<br>
<br>

Incremental Optimization (append more images to extend the reconstruction):
<br>
5.  Finding Correspondence between the new image & previous frame
<br>
6.  Estimating new camera poses from Perspective-n-Point (PnP)
<br>
7.  Adding 3D new points  by Triangulation
<br>
8.  Minimizing reprojection error by Bundle Adjustment (BA)
<br>

1.2: Input
======
<br>
TempleRing Dataset is used. It contains 46 images in total from 00.png to 45.png, capturing a 2D view of the object from different views.

1.3: Outputs

<br> I also saved the 3D points in .ply format which can be viewed from [free online PLY file viewer](https://products.aspose.app/3d/viewer/ply).
