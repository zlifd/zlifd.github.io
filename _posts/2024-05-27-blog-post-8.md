A tutorial to share network via Wi-Fi Hotspot in Ubuntu Desktop 22.04

If your desktop is using ethernet cable to access the inernet, you can share your network like a router in your desktop uisng a Wi-Fi adapter.
<br>

Step0 (Optional):<br>
Plug in the USB Wi-Fi adapter to your computer so that it can access internet via Wi-Fi. You may skip this step if your desktop can access Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Hotspot directly.

Step1: <br>
open terminal, run the cmd `sudo ufw disable` to disable the firewall

Step2: <br>
Go to `Settings` > `Wi-Fi`, then Turn on Wi-Fi Hotspot


<br>
Done!
<br>
You may now share the network obtained from ethernet cable in your desktop with other devices, like your phone. It will act as a router to allow others to access your internet internally. (Of course, you will have to enter password as usual)
