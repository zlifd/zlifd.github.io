A tutorial for setting up ZCU104 for Vitis-AI

Step1: <br>
Download board image<br>
Go to [Vitis AI User Guide (UG1414)](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug1414-vitis-ai/Setting-Up-the-Evaluation-Board) and download the board image for [ZCU104](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/zcu104.html). You may have to login with your Xilinx account first. And remember to set the board to MicroSD card boot mode according to the figure from the User Guide.

Step2: <br>
Burn the image to a MicroSD Card.<br>
You may use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to burn the board image into the MicroSD Card. Remember to unzip the file to .img format before burning.

Step3: <br>
Make the ./root folder writeable<br>
After burning the board image to MicroSD Card, we have to make the root file in the card writeable. To do that, navigate to `/home/root` folder of the SD card in a PC, run <br>
`sudo chmod -R 777 root`
<br>
After that you should be able to put your files in `/home/root` which is your home directory for your ZCU104.

Step4: <br>
Install Minicom (similar to PuTTY from Window) so that we can communicate to the board via UART in Ubuntu. Open terminal in Linux and type in the following cmd<br>
`sudo apt-get install minicom`

Step5:<br>
Setup appropriate port. <br>
`sudo minicom -s`
<br>
This will open the minicom configuration menu. In the configuration menu, navigate to`Serial port setup` and press Enter. Set the serial device to the appropriate port for your ZCU104 board. This can usually be found by checking the output of the dmesg command after connecting the board. It will typically be something like /dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0. <br>
For my case, it is in `/dev/ttyUSB1`

Set the baud rate to 115200.
<br>
Set the hardware flow control to "No".
<br>
Press Enter to save the configuration and exit the menu.
<br>
Run the following command to start minicom:
<br>
`sudo minicom`
<br>
You should now be connected to the ZCU104 board via minicom.
