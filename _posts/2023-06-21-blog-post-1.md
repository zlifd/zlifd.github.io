Running Pytorch in C++
======
A tutorial for using Pytorch library in C++.

Most of the people use Pytorch in python to build up the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, such as in Jupyter Notebook. It is the most common and a faster way to do so. But if we want to make a hardware acceleration to speed up the performance, like using [Vitis HLS](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-hls.html) from Xilinx, python is not suitable because it only supports C/C++. Hence, we may rebuild our CNN model in C++ with the aid of Pytorch which can make our live more easier. As a result, we can accelerate the algorithm using the concepts like pipeline and loop unrolling from Vitis HLS. 

This tutorial will show you how to load Pytorch library into C++ under the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in macOS Catalina version 10.15.7 environment. 

Prerequsite: <br>
You should have install Pytorch in your environment already. 

Step1: <br>
Open terminal and run the following cmd to print put the location path of your Pytorch. And remember to store the location first.<br>
`python -c 'import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)'`

Step2:<br>
Navigate to the directory containing your main.cpp (your .cpp file that build the CNN model)

Step3:<br>
Create a file called CMakeLists.txt and paste the the following codes in and save it.<br>
#########################################################

`cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)` <br>
`project(example-app)`<br>
`find_package(Torch REQUIRED)`<br>
`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${TORCH_CXX_FLAGS}")`<br>
`add_executable(main main.cpp)`<br>
`target_link_libraries(main "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")`<br>
`set_property(TARGET main PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14)`

#########################################################

Step4:<br>
Back to the terminal in Step1, type in the following cmd sequentially.

`mkdir build`<br>
`cd build`<br>
`cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=[paste your pathway that you stored in Step1]`<br>
`cmake --build . --config Release`

Step5:<br>
Done! <br>
You may run the output file to see the result by cmd<br>
`./main`

Hope you enjoy this :)
