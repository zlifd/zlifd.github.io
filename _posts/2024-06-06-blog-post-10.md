Blog Post #10
======
Upgrading Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04

Step0:
<br>
`lsb_release -a`
<br>
Cmd to check the current Ubutnu version

`df -H`
<br>
Cmd to check storage, better to have 25GB or above before upgrading

<br>
Step1:
<br>
`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`
`sudo apt dist-upgrade`

Make sure to update & upgrade all the packages before upgrading the whole system 

`sudo apt autoremove`
Cmd to remove unnecessary installation package 

`sudo apt install update-manager-core`
`sudo reboot`


<br>
Step2:
<br>
`sudo do-release-upgrade --check-dist-upgrade-only`
`sudo do-release-upgrade -d --allow-third-party`

Ideally, it should start to upgrade. But if you encounter error like `please install all available updates for your release before upgrading`, that's mean you haven't update all the packages with the `sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`, to solve the problem, you will need to manually update ALL of them in `Software Updater` until your computer is up to date like below:
