Blog Post #10
======
Upgrading Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04

Step0:
<br>
`lsb_release -a`
<br>
Cmd to check the current Ubutnu version

`df -H`
<br>
Cmd to check storage, better to have 25GB or above before upgrading

<br>
Step1:
<br>

`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`

`sudo apt dist-upgrade`

Make sure to update & upgrade all the packages before upgrading the whole system 

`sudo apt autoremove`

Cmd to remove unnecessary installation package 

`sudo apt install update-manager-core`

`sudo reboot`


<br>
Step2:
<br>

`sudo do-release-upgrade --check-dist-upgrade-only`

`sudo do-release-upgrade -d --allow-third-party`

Troubleshooting #1

Ideally, it should start to upgrade. But if you encounter error like `please install all available updates for your release before upgrading`, that's mean you haven't update all the packages with the `sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`, to solve the problem, you will need to manually update ALL of them in `Software Updater` until your computer is up to date like below:

Troubleshooting #2
After reboot, if you can't even turn it on and a similar screen pop up like below, maybe there is a contradiction between the newly updated system and the driver of the graphic card (not sure whether you will face the same error, but at least it is for my case). To check whether you are in this case, please follow the steps below:

Firstly, power on the computer in `recovery mode`, then press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F4` and login as sudo user, run cmd `sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`, if you encounter errors related to the driver descripted above, you may refer to the steps below to solve the problem.

```bash
cd /var/lib/dpkg
sudo mv info info.bak
sudo mkdir info
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

After that, `sudo reboot now` it, it should work fine now.

Troubleshooting #3

After upgrading and login successfully, running `nvidia-smi` brings you error msg `NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldnâ€˜t communicate with the NVIDIA driver.`It means it still can't recognise the Nvidia Driver. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common
sudo ubuntu-drivers devices
```

Since it recommends nvidia-driver-535, so you may install it by 
`sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535`

However, if you face `gcc-11-base` library contradictioon between the old UbuntuOS and the newly updated UbuntuOS, please delete all the `gcc-11-base` library via `sudo apt remove gcc-11-base`
And finally `sudo reboot` it
