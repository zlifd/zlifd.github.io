Blog Post #10
======
Upgrading Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04

Step0:
<br>
`lsb_release -a`
<br>
Cmd to check the current Ubutnu version

`df -H`
<br>
Cmd to check storage, better to have 25GB or above before upgrading

<br>
Step1:
<br>
`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`
`sudo apt dist-upgrade`

Make sure to update & upgrade all the packages before upgrading the whole system 

`sudo apt autoremove`
Cmd to remove unnecessary installation package 

`sudo apt install update-manager-core`
`sudo reboot`


<br>
Step2:
`sudo do-release-upgrade --check-dist-upgrade-only`
`sudo do-release-upgrade -d --allow-third-party`

Disasters around the world affect millions of people every year. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from any map, and the first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. With computers and internet connection, we will compare satellite images and add buildings and roads to a shared online map that will be made available for all humanitarian organizations worldwide.

全球每年都有數以百萬計人陷入大型災難之中，但許多發展中地區在地圖上仍然是一片空白，由於缺乏比較精準的地圖，當遇上災害時，許多人道救援組織都未能了解這些地區的人口和建築物分佈，以致難於掌握災情及策劃救援行動。你可在家中參與繪製數碼地圖，透過衞星圖片尋找建築物，將這些消失的國度重現於地圖之上，為國際救援作好準備。

I participated in one of the Community service - [Mapathon](https://connect.hkust.edu.hk/get-involved/opportunities/240424-mapathon-hkust) in April 24th 2024, where I helped to map the residential building blocks located somewhere in Durban, South Africa. Such kind of meaningful event helps me to broaden my horizon. I am glad that I can help the underprivileged in the developing counteries even I am in Hong Kong via Zoom. Thanks [HKUSTConect](https://connect.hkust.edu.hk/) for providing such precious opportunity to me to serve for the public.
