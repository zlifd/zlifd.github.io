A tutorial for setting up Vitis AI

[Vitis AI](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-ai.html) is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Xilinx for AI inference on hardware platform, such as ZCU102/ZCU104 FPGA board. It supports different frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow from the user application. Comparing to the method using [High-level synthesis (HLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis), Vitis AI provodes a simpler way to help for optimizing the Neural Network (NN) model and incresae the efficiency for AI acceleration.    

This tutorial will show you how to set up the Vitis AI on Ubuntu 23.04 environment. 


Step1: <br>
Open terminal and run the following cmd to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) first.<br>
`sudo apt install docker.io`

Step2:<br>
Initialize Docker by cmd. <br>
`sudo docker run hello-world`

Step3:<br>
Clone the repository of Vitis AI from Github.<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI`


Step4:<br>
Navigate to the directory of Vitis AI and run it.<br>
`cd Vitis-AI`<br>
`sudo ./docker_run.sh xilinx/vitis-ai`<br>
If you see something like permission denied for running docker_run.sh, then run the following cmd to give permission.<br>
`chmod +x docker_run.sh`<br>

Step5:<br>
Done!<br>
If you are using Pytorch, you may use the following cmd to activate the environment<br>
`conda activate vitis-ai-pytorch`
You should see something similar as below:
