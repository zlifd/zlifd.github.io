Hello! Greeting from Zhengdong LI, Tony:)
=====
I am currently a MPhil student from the Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering ([ECE](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/)) in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)), under the supervision of [Prof. Chik Patrick YUE](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=chik-patrick-yue-eepatrick) from Optical Wireless Lab ([OWL](https://yuegroup.hkust.edu.hk/)) and co-supervised by [Prof. Wei ZHANG](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=wei-zhang-eeweiz) from Reconfigurable Computing Systems Lab ([RCSL](https://eeweiz.home.ece.ust.hk/index.html)). Previously during my time at HKUST, I completed my BEng with major in Computer Engineering ([CPEG](https://cpeg.hkust.edu.hk/eng/programs/beng_4yr.html)) and minor in Mathematics. 



Research Interests
